# requirements

- You have to make the static page for all the elements in the designs
- The links and other pages are not expected to load and they can point to the same
  page
- Other sections like jobs, etc are not required to be made dynamic
- The UI should look as close to the designs as possible (very important)

# Expectation:

- Write quality code as you would write in a production environment
- Make regular git commits so that it’s easy to evaluate your approach and
  progression throughout the day
- Test cases are good to have but not required
- You are free to use any component library and CSS framework if you want. We use
  multiple things on multiple projects - tailwind, bootstrap, and vanilla CSS. If not
  sure lean on plain old CSS and basics and you should be fine. We prefer if you
  don’t use any CSS framework.
- Do your best to name and arrange files/components/variables as you would in a
  production-ready application.

# Bonus:

- Make search work with the API :)
